## Annotated Parse Tree
An annotated parse tree is a hierarchical representation of the syntactic structure of a program's source code. It demonstrates how the grammar rules are applied during the parsing process. Each node in the tree corresponds to a grammar rule or a token in the input code, and it may carry additional information, such as the type of the token or the value it holds.

3-Address Code: 3-address code is a low-level representation of code that simplifies complex expressions into a series of simple instructions. Each instruction typically operates on two operands and produces a result that is stored in a temporary variable. This form of code is often used as an intermediate representation in compilers before further optimization or translation to machine code.

Now, let's consider an example expression: `a = b * (c + d)`

Annotated Parse Tree:
```r
         =
       /   \
      a    *
          / \
         b   +
            / \
           c   d
```
Explanation: Here, the annotated parse tree shows the assignment operation where the variable 'a' is assigned the result of the multiplication operation. The multiplication operation itself involves the variable 'b' and the addition operation. The addition operation involves variables 'c' and 'd'.

Example
```r
1. t1 = c + d
2. t2 = b * t1
3. a = t2
```
Explanation: The 3-address code breaks down the expression into simple instructions. First, it computes the sum of 'c' and 'd' and stores the result in temporary variable 't1'. Then, it multiplies 'b' with 't1' and stores the result in temporary variable 't2'. Finally, it assigns the value of 't2' to 'a'.
