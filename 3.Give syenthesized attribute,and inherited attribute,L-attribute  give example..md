## Synthesized , inherited attributes and L-attributes.

1. **Synthesized Attribute**: Synthesized attributes are attributes whose values are computed at a node based on the values of its children in the parse tree. These values are synthesized or computed bottom-up during tree traversal.

Example:
Consider a grammar for arithmetic expressions:

```
E -> E + T | T
T -> T * F | F
F -> (E) | id
```

Now, let's define a synthesized attribute `value` for each non-terminal representing the value of the expression:

```
E -> E1 + T { E.value = E1.value + T.value; }
   | T { E.value = T.value; }
T -> T1 * F { T.value = T1.value * F.value; }
   | F { T.value = F.value; }
F -> (E) { F.value = E.value; }
   | id { F.value = id.value; }
```

In this example, `value` is synthesized because it's computed based on the values of its children in the parse tree.

2. **Inherited Attribute**: Inherited attributes are attributes that are passed down from parent nodes to their children during tree traversal. These attributes are computed top-down during parsing.

	Example:
	**A → BC { B.val = A.val, C.val = B.val}**  
	Here, in the case of **B.val = A.val,** A is the parent of B. So, B is inheriting the attribute from its parent.

## S and L attributed SDT

**S-attributed SDT :**

- If an SDT uses only synthesized attributes, it is called as S-attributed SDT.
- bottom-up parsing

**L-attributed SDT:**

- If an SDT uses both synthesized attributes and inherited attributes with a restriction that inherited attribute can inherit values from left siblings only, it is called as L-attributed SDT.
- Depth-first and left-to-right parsing manner.
