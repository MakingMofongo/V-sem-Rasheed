## Synthesized , inherited attributes and L-attributes.

1. **Synthesized Attribute**: Synthesized attributes are attributes whose values are computed at a node based on the values of its children in the parse tree. These values are synthesized or computed bottom-up during tree traversal.

Example:
Consider a grammar for arithmetic expressions:

```
E -> E + T | T
T -> T * F | F
F -> (E) | id
```

Now, let's define a synthesized attribute `value` for each non-terminal representing the value of the expression:

```
E -> E1 + T { E.value = E1.value + T.value; }
   | T { E.value = T.value; }
T -> T1 * F { T.value = T1.value * F.value; }
   | F { T.value = F.value; }
F -> (E) { F.value = E.value; }
   | id { F.value = id.value; }
```

In this example, `value` is synthesized because it's computed based on the values of its children in the parse tree.

2. **Inherited Attribute**: Inherited attributes are attributes that are passed down from parent nodes to their children during tree traversal. These attributes are computed top-down during parsing.

Example:
Consider a grammar for a simple if-else statement:

```
S -> if (E) S1 else S2 | other
```

Now, let's define an inherited attribute `hasElse` to indicate whether an if statement has an else clause:

```
S -> if (E) S1 else S2 { S.hasElse = true; }
   | other { S.hasElse = false; }
```

In this example, `hasElse` is inherited because its value is determined at the parent node (`S`), and it's passed down to its children (`S1` and `S2`).

3. **L-attribute**: An L-attribute is a synthesized attribute whose value is computed by traversing the parse tree from left to right and from bottom to top. These attributes can be computed using only attributes from nodes that have been already visited.

Example:
Consider a grammar for a simple while loop:

```
S -> while (E) S1
```

Now, let's define an L-attribute `loopDepth` to indicate the depth of nested while loops:

```
S -> while (E) S1 { S.loopDepth = S1.loopDepth + 1; }
   | other { S.loopDepth = 0; }
```

In this example, `loopDepth` is an L-attribute because its value is computed bottom-up and left-to-right during tree traversal.

These concepts are fundamental in attribute grammar, which is often used in syntax-directed translation and semantic analysis during compiler design.
