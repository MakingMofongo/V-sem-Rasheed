## Synthesized , inherited attributes and L-attributes.

1. **Synthesized Attribute**: Synthesized attributes are attributes whose values are computed at a node based on the values of its children in the parse tree. These values are synthesized or computed bottom-up during tree traversal.

Example:
Consider a grammar for arithmetic expressions:

```
E -> E + T | T
T -> T * F | F
F -> (E) | id
```

Now, let's define a synthesized attribute `value` for each non-terminal representing the value of the expression:

```
E -> E1 + T { E.value = E1.value + T.value; }
   | T { E.value = T.value; }
T -> T1 * F { T.value = T1.value * F.value; }
   | F { T.value = F.value; }
F -> (E) { F.value = E.value; }
   | id { F.value = id.value; }
```

In this example, `value` is synthesized because it's computed based on the values of its children in the parse tree.

2. **Inherited Attribute**: Inherited attributes are attributes that are passed down from parent nodes to their children during tree traversal. These attributes are computed top-down during parsing.

Example:
Consider a grammar for a simple if-else statement:

```
S -> if (E) S1 else S2 | other
```

Now, let's define an inherited attribute `hasElse` to indicate whether an if statement has an else clause:

```
S -> if (E) S1 else S2 { S.hasElse = true; }
   | other { S.hasElse = false; }
```

In this example, `hasElse` is inherited because its value is determined at the parent node (`S`), and it's passed down to its children (`S1` and `S2`).
