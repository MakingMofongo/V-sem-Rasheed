## 9.What are design issues in code generator

1. **Target Machine Independence**: Designing the code generator to be independent of the target machine architecture allows the compiler to generate code for different hardware platforms without significant modification. This often involves generating intermediate code representations or using target-specific code generation modules.

2. **Register Management**: Allocating and assigning registers effectively to minimize register pressure and optimize the usage of limited hardware resources.

3. **Instruction Selection**: Deciding which machine instructions or sequences of instructions best represent high-level language constructs while considering performance and code size trade-offs.

4. **Optimization Strategy**: Implementing optimization techniques such as Redundant load-and-store, Strength Reduction, Simplifying Algebraic Expressions, Replace Slower Instructions with faster Equivalents, Dead code elimination to improve the efficiency and performance of the generated code.
