## Peephole optimization
Peephole optimization is a technique used in compiler optimization where a small window or "peephole" of code is examined and transformed to improve the efficiency of the generated code. This optimization technique focuses on identifying and replacing specific patterns or sequences of instructions with more efficient equivalents.

In peephole optimization, the compiler looks for patterns of code within a limited number of consecutive instructions. It analyzes these patterns and applies transformations to eliminate redundant or inefficient code sequences.

Common optimizations performed using peephole optimization include Redundant load-and-store, Strength Reduction, Simplifying Algebraic Expressions, Replace Slower Instructions with faster Equivalents, Dead code elimination
