The Minimax algorithm is a decision-making algorithm commonly used in two-player, zero-sum games, such as chess, checkers, or tic-tac-toe. It's designed to determine the optimal strategy for a player by minimizing the possible loss (hence "min") while assuming the opponent will maximize their own advantage (hence "max"). Here are detailed notes and steps for the Minimax method:

1. **Overview**:
   - The Minimax algorithm aims to find the best move for a player by recursively evaluating the possible outcomes of each move and selecting the one that minimizes the maximum possible loss.

2. **Assumptions**:
   - The game is deterministic, meaning the outcome of each move is fully determined by the current state.
   - The game is adversarial, with two players taking turns making moves, and each player trying to maximize their own advantage while minimizing their opponent's advantage.
   - The game is zero-sum, meaning one player's gain is the other player's loss; the total payoff is constant.

3. **Steps**:
   1. **Recursion**:
      - The Minimax algorithm operates recursively, exploring the game tree to a certain depth or until a terminal state (win, lose, or draw) is reached.
   
   2. **Evaluation Function**:
      - At the terminal states or at a specified depth limit, an evaluation function is used to estimate the desirability of the resulting state for the current player.
      - In simple games, this function might assign scores based on factors like the number of pieces on the board or the position of pieces.
   
   3. **Maximizing and Minimizing Steps**:
      - When it's the player's turn to move (the maximizing player), the algorithm selects the move that leads to the maximum score among its possible successor states.
      - When it's the opponent's turn to move (the minimizing player), the algorithm assumes the opponent will select the move that leads to the minimum score among its possible successor states.
   
   4. **Backtracking**:
      - The algorithm backtracks to the previous level of the game tree after evaluating all possible moves at a given depth.
      - At each level, the algorithm alternates between maximizing and minimizing players until it reaches the specified depth or terminal states.

4. **Pseudocode**:
   ```c
   function minimax(node, depth, maximizingPlayer)
       if depth = 0 or node is a terminal node
           return the heuristic value of node
       if maximizingPlayer
           bestValue := -INFINITY
           for each child of node
               value := minimax(child, depth - 1, FALSE)
               bestValue := max(bestValue, value)
           return bestValue
       else
           bestValue := +INFINITY
           for each child of node
               value := minimax(child, depth - 1, TRUE)
               bestValue := min(bestValue, value)
           return bestValue
   ```

5. **Example**:
   - Consider a game of tic-tac-toe. The Minimax algorithm would evaluate each possible move for the current player and its opponent, assuming optimal play from both sides, until reaching a terminal state or a specified depth limit. It would then choose the move that leads to the best outcome for the current player while considering the opponent's best response.

The Minimax algorithm provides a systematic approach to decision-making in adversarial environments and forms the basis for more advanced game-playing algorithms like Alpha-Beta pruning and Monte Carlo Tree Search.
