{"path":"unit-1-notess.pdf","text":"Artificial Intelligence Unit 1 Introduction to Intelligent System Topic-1 Definition and What is AI??? It is the science and engineering of making intelligent machines, especially intelligent computer programs. It is related to the similar task of using computers to understand human intelligence, but AI does not have to confine itself to methods that are biologically observable. It is the study of how to make computers do things which at the moment people do better. It fails to include some areas of potentially large impact namely problems that cannot now be solved well by either computers or people. It is the automation of activities that we associate with human thinking, activities such as decision making, problem solving, learning . Intelligence +System  AI AI is the study of how to make computers do things at which at the movement people are better. Need for AI: To supplement natural intelligence for e.g we are building intelligence in an object so that it can do what we want it to do, as for example-- robots, thus reducing human labour and reducing human mistakes. Defining AI – 2 dimensions  Thought processes and reasoning  Behaviour Rationality means –> doing right things Rational agent – agent that does the right thing to achieve the best outcome 4 categories of AI definitions  Systems that think like humans  Systems that act like humans  Systems that think rationally  Systems that act rationally Possible Approaches AI WORK ON Rational Agent and Heuristic Search Think like humans • Focus not just on behavior and I/O but also look at reasoning process. • Computational model should reflect \"how\" results were obtained. • Provide a new language for expressing cognitive theories and new mechanisms for evaluating them • GPS (General Problem Solver): Goal not just to produce humanlike behavior, but to produce a sequence of steps of the reasoning process that was similar to the steps followed by a person in solving the same task. Act like humans • Not interested in how you get results, just the similarity to what human results are. • Also interested in comparability to human behavior over correctness. • The “Turing Test” approaches. Think well • Develop formal models of knowledge representation, reasoning, learning,memory, problem solving, that can be rendered in algorithms. • There is often an emphasis on systems that are provably correct, and guarantee finding an optimal solution. Act well • For a given set of inputs, generate an output that gets the job done: achieve the best (expected) outcome. • Depends on formal methods but also on heuristics as needed. • A heuristic is a rule of thumb, simplification, or other device which drastically limits search for solutions in large problem spaces. • Heuristics do not guarantee optimal solutions, but a useful heuristic offers solutions which are good enough most of the time. – Feigenbaum and Feldman, 1963, p. 6 • “Rational agent” approach, and the approach we will mostly follow. So when WILL we decide that computers are intelligent? --Using Turing Test Topic-2 What is Turing Test Approach??? (Act like human) • Three rooms contain a person, a computer, and an interrogator • The interrogator can communicate with the other two by teleprinter. • The interrogator tries to determine which is the person and which is the machine. • The machine tries to fool the interrogator into believing that it is the person. • If the machine succeeds, then we conclude that the machine can think.  Operational definition of intelligence  Human interrogator  Capabilities needed for a computer to pass turing test  Natural language processing  Knowledge representation  Automated reasoning  Machine learning  Computer vision  robotics Cognitive modelling approach (think like human)  To determine how humans think  Introspection – self-experiments  Psychological experiments  General problem solver  Cognitive science  Experimental investigation of humans and animals Laws of thought approach(think rationally)  Right thinking  Reasoning process  Syllogisms  Ex:- Socrates is a man All men are mortal Socrates is mortal.  Operation of mind  Logic  Rational Agent approach(act rationally) Topic-3 Foundations of artificial intelligence 1.Philosophy • Can formal rules be used to draw valid conclusions • How does mental mind arise from a physical brain • Where does knowledge come from • How does knowledge lead to action • Aristotile – syllogisms for reasoning • Ramon lull – concept wheels • Mechanical calculator • Calculating machine 2. Mathematics • What are the formal rules to draw valid conclusions • What can be computed • How do we reason with uncertain information • Logic , computation, probability 3.Economics • How should we make decisions so as to maximize payoff • How should we do this when others may not go along • How should we do this when the payoff may be far in the future • Decision theory – probability theory+ utility theory 4.Neuroscience • How do brain process information 5.Psychology • How do humans and animals think and act • Behaviourism 6.Computer Engineering • How can we build an efficient computer 7. Control Theory and Cybernetics • How can artifacts operate under their own control • Control theory • Cybernetics • Objective function 8.Linguistics • How does language relate to thought • Computational linguistics - Its main aim is depend upon the situation to take the decisions automatically. - AI is the scientific research, this research will begin from past are years , are origin is JAPAN. - AI is the part of the Computer Science Concerned with designing, intelligent computer systems, that is systems that exhibits the characteristics we associate with intelligence in Human Behavior. Once again this definition will raise the following question. “Intelligent Behavior “, in view of the difficulty in defining the Intelligence, Let us try to characteristics that is a list of number of characteristics by which we can identify the Human Intelligence . 1. To respond situations very flexibility. 2. To make sense of out of ambiguity to the are messages. 3. To recognize the relative importance of different elements of a situation. 4. To find similarities between situations despite the differences which my separate them. 5. To draw distinction between situations despite similarities which may link them. AI is the branch of Computer science dealing with symbolic non algorithmic methods of a problem solving. AI is the branch of computer science that deals with ways of representing knowledge by using symbols rather are numbers and with rules of thumb, or heuristic methods for processing. AI works with pattern matching methods which attempts to describe objects, events and processes in terms of their qualitative features and logical and computational relationships. While reading the above definitions one must be remember keeping in mind that the AI is fast new developing science. These are challenges now facing researchers in AI. But AI researchers shown people are more Intelligent than Computers, AI tries to improve the performance of computers in activities that people do better, then the goal of AI is to make computers more Intelligent. AI researches have show that “ Intelligence requires knowledge”, and knowledge itself posses some less desirable activities of Real Life Situations. It voluminous It is hard characterize accurately It is constantly changing It differs from data It is organized data AI is the branch of computer science that deals with ways of representing knowledge by using symbols rather than numbers and with rules of thumb, or heuristic methods for processing. AI works with pattern matching methods which attempts to describe objects, events and processes in terms of their qualitative features and logical and computational relationships. While reading the above definitions one must be remember keeping in mind that the AI is fast new developing science. Thus it is having both Scientific and Engineering goals. AI is the part of the Computer Science concerned with designing, intelligent computer systems, that is systems that exhibit the characteristics we associate with intelligence in Human Behavior. Once again this definition will raise the following question. “Intelligent Behavior “, in view of the difficulty in defining the Intelligence, Let us try to characterize that is a list of number of characteristics by which we can identify the Human Intelligence. It is related to the similar task of using computers to understand Human Intelligence. The term AI is referred to known as Intelligent Behavior in Artifacts. Artifacts are Man-Made Machines. Thus AI is related with Psychology, Cognition, and Behavioral Science. Thus we have to consider the following Characteristics that are passed by an AI System 1. Perception 2. Reasoning 3. Learning 4. Communicating 5. Acting in Complex Environments. These are the challenges now facing researchers in AI. AI Languages For developing the AI application the researchers use the two languages. 1. LISP – List Processing 2. PROLOG – PROgramming in LOGic. LISP is used mainly in America for developing the AI application. PROLOG is used in Japan and the other Europe countries for develop the AI applications. Where as in image processing researchers use the natural computer languages FORTRAN & C. In export systems the researchers use the “OOPS-5”. FIFTH GENERATION PROJECT:- To identify the importance of “Artificial Intelligence” JAPAN start the FIFTH GENERATION PROJECT 14 years back. JAPAN government gave the permission to make the special computers for AI applications. INDIAN IN FIFTH GENERATION PROJECT:- INDIA also started FIFTH GENERATIN PROJECT 8 years back, for this INDIAN GOVERNMENT gave the permission to the IIT , ISI( Calcutta) ., IISI (Bangalore)., till no there is no response. Before studying an AI problem and trying to solve it, the following have to be considered: - Assumption to be used in solving the problem - Techniques to be used in solving the problem - The level of detail at with we are trying to model human intelligence - How to know when we have succeeded in building an intelligent program. Knowledge Point of You only ---- Will Artificial Intelligence Applications Rules Future Information Technology.? Yes.AI Applications are the talk of IT industry today. Pattern Recognition and Image Processing, Expert systems(Knowledge based Computer Systems) are the major concern of AI research. The computers of today are knowledge Information processing systems. Expert systems in turn, embody modules of organized knowledge about specific areas of Human Expertise. They also support sophisticated problem- solving and inference functions, providing users with a source of intelligent advice on some specialized topic. Expert systems also provide human oriented I/O in the form of natural Languages, speech, and picture images. For example an Expert System for Medical Diagnosis could operate in the way analogous to the way a Physician, a surgeon, and a patient interact and use their knowledge to make a diagnosis. Symbol manipulation: In Expert systems(Knowledge based Computer Systems), ”Knowledge” is often represented in terms of IF… THEN rules of the form: IF Codition.1 and Condition.2 and __________ __________ Condition n THEN implication (with significance) If all conditions are true, then the implication is true, with an associated logical significance factor. While a set of rules is searched, an overall significance factor is manipulated, and when this significance becomes unacceptably low the search is abounded and a view set of rules is searched. This structure of expert systems is most closely matched by the structure of logical programming (its computational model). In a logic programming language such as LISP & PROLOG. Prolog statements are relations of a restricted form called ”Clauses”’ and the execution of such program is a suitably controlled logic deduction from the Clauses forming the program. A Clause is a Well formed Formula consisting of Conjunction and Disjunction of Literals. The following logic program for family three Conditions of four Clauses. Father (Bill, John) Father (John, Tom) Grandfather (X,Z) :- father (X,Y) ,mother (Y,Z). Grandfather (X,Z) :- father (X,Y) ,father (Y,Z). The first two clauses define that Bill is the father of John, second two clauses use the variables X, Y and Z to represent (express) the rule that if X is the grandfather of Z, if X is the father of Y and Y is either the mother or father of Z . Such a program can be asked a range of questions- from “ is John, the father of Tom?” [Father (John, Tom)?] To “ Is there any A who is the grandfather of C?”[Grandfather (A, C)?] . The possible operation of computer based on logic is illustrated in the following using the family tree program. Execution of , for example “Grandfather (Bill,R)?”Will match each “Grandfather ( ) “ Clause. Grandfather ( X=Bill, Z=R ) :- father (Bill,Y),mother (Y,R). Grandfather ( X=Bill, Z=R ) :- father (Bill,Y),father (Y,R). Both clauses will attempt in parallel to satisfy their Goals, such a concept is called OR – Parallelism. The first clause will fail being unable to satisfy its goal, search will continues to the second clause i.e., called OR – Parallelism. The first clause will fail being unable to satisfy the “Mother( )” goal form the program. The second goal has “Father( )” , “Mother( )” , which is attempt to solve in parallel, such a concept is called AND parallelism. The later concept involves Pattern Matching methods and substitution to satisfy both the individual goals. Grandfather (X=Bill, Z=R) : - father (Bill,Y), father (Y,R). :-father(Bill,Y=John), father (Y=Bill,R=John). And the Overall Consistency :-father(Bill,Y=John),father (Y=John,R=Tom). Computers Organization supporting Expert Systems is a highly micro programmed(Control Flow Based). PROLOG machines analogous to current Lisp machines although we can expect a number of such designs in the near feature. PROLOG machines are not TRUE Logic Machines. Just as LISP Machines are not considered reduction machines liked by a Common logic Machine language and architecture. Future Potential:- Further Developments in Future in the area of AI Research will be in hopeful manner. Fifth Generation Project:- Form the basis of what is called Intelligent Consumer Electronics. Further developments of this type of computer is motivated by the fact that these electronics will be the major money earning industry. Conclusion:- If AI Applications from Fifth Generation Project are successfully implemented the above said Logic programs through Perceptual activities i.e. a day will come very soon to act the Computer as Human Brain, ie., what we call Intelligent Computer.

Neural Architecture. 15. Heuristic Classification. 1 Problem Solving:- This is the first application area of AI research., the objective of this particular area of research is how to implement the procedures on AI systems to solve the problems like Human Beings. 2 :- Game Playing:- Much of early research in state space search was done using common board games such as checkers, chess and 8 puzzle. Most games are played using a well defined set of rules. This makes it easy to generate the search space and frees the researcher from many of the ambiguities and complexities inherent in less structured problems. The board Configurations used in playing these games are easily represented in computer, requiring none of complex formalisms. For solving large and complex AI problems it requires lots of techniques like Heuristics. We commonly used the term intelligence seems to reside in the heuristics used by Human beings to solve the problems. 3 :- Theorem Proving:- Theorem proving is another application area of AI research., ie. To prove Boolean Algebra theorems as a humans we first try to prove Lemma., i.e it tell us whether the Theorem is having feasible solution or not. If the theorem having feasible solution we will try to prove it otherwise discard it., In the same way whether the AI system will react to prove Lemma before trying to attempting to prove a theorem., is the focus of this application area of research. 4 Natural Langauge understading:- The main goal of this problem is we can ask the question to the computer in our mother tongue the computer can receive that particular language and the system gave the response with in the same language. The effective use of a Computer has involved the use off a Programming Language of a set of Commands that we must use to Communicate with the Computer. The goal of natural language processing is to enable people and language such as English, rather than in a computer language. It can be divided in to Two sub fields. Natural Language Understanding : Which investigates methods of allowing the Computer to improve instructions given in ordinary English so that Computers can understand people more easily. Natural Language Generation : This aims to have Computers produce ordinary English language so that people an understand Computers more easily. 5. Perception:- The process of perception is usually involves that the set of operations i.e. Touching , Smelling Listening , Tasting , and Eating. These Perceptual activities incorporation into Intelligent Computer System is concerned with the areas of Natural language Understanding & Processing and Computer Vision mainly. The are two major Challenges in the application area of Perception. 1. Speech Reorganization 2. Pattern Reorganization ¨Speech Reorganization:- The main goal of this problem is how the Computer System can recognize our Speeches. (Next process is to understand those Speeches and process them i.e. Encoding & Decoding i.e producing the result in the same language.) Its one is very difficult; Speech Reorganization can be described in two ways. 1. Discrete Speech Reorganization Means People can interact with the Computer in their mother tongue. In such interaction whether they can insert time gap in between the two words or two sentences (In this type of Speech Reorganization the computer takes some time for searching the database). 2. Continues Speech Reorganization Means when we interact with the computer in our mother tongue we can not insert the time gap in between the two words or sentences , i.e. we can talk continuously with the Computer (For this purpose we can increase speed of the computer). ¨Pattern Reorganization: - this the computer can identify the real world objects with the help of “Camera”. Its one is also very difficult , because - To identify the regular shape objects, we can see that object from any angle; we can imagine the actual shape of the object (means to picturise which part is light fallen) through this we can identify the total structure of that particular object. -To identify the irregular shape things, we can see that particular thing from any angle; through this we cannot imagine the actual structure. With help of that we can attach the Camera to the computer and picturise certain part of the light fallen image with the help of that whether the AI system can recognize the actual structure of the image or not? It is some what difficult compare to the regular shape things, till now the research is going on. This is related the application area of Computer Vision. A Pattern is a quantitative or structured description of an object or some other entity of interest of an Image. Pattern is found an arrangement of descriptors. Pattern recognition is the research area that studies the operation and design of systems that recognize patterns in data. It encloses the discriminate analysis, feature extraction, error estimation, cluster analysis, and parsing (sometimes called syntactical pattern recognition). Important application areas are image analysis, character recognition, speech recognition and analysis, man and machine diagnostics, person identification and industrial inspection. Closely Related Areas Pattern Recognition Artificial Intelligence Expert systems and machine learning Neural Networks Computer Vision Cognition Perception Image Processing 6.Image Processing: - Where as in pattern reorganization we can catch the image of real world things with the help of Camera. The goal of Image Processing is to identify the relations between the parts of image. It is a simple task to attach a Camera to a computer so that the computer can receive visual images. People generally use Vision as their primary means of sensing their environment. We generally see more than we here. i.e. how can we provide such perceptual facilities touch, smell, taste, listen, and eat to the AI System. The goal of Computer Vision research is to give computers this powerful facility for understanding their surroundings. Currently, one of the primary uses of Computer Vision is in the area of Robotics. Ex: - We can take a Satellite image to identify the roots and forests; we can make digitize all the image and place on the disk. With the help of particular scale to convert the image in to dots form, later we can identify that particular image at any time. Its one is time consuming process. With the help of “ image processing” how to reduce the time to process an image till now the AI research will be continuously going on. In Image Processing the process of image recognition can be broken into the following main stages. · Image capture · Edge detection · Segmentation · Recognition and Analysis. Image capturing can be performed by a simple Camera, which converts light signals from a scale of electrical signals., i.e., done by human visual system. We obtained these light signals in a set of 0’s and 1’s. Each pixel takes on one of a number of possible values often from 0 to 255. Color images are broken down in the same way, but with varying colors instead of gray scales. When a computer receives an image from sensor in form of set of pixels. These pixels are integrated to give the computer an understanding of what it is perceiving. An image has been obtained, is to determine where the edges are in the image, the very first stage of analysis is called edge detection. Objects in the real world are almost all have solid edges of one kind or another, detecting those images is first step in the process of determining which objects are present in a scene. Once the edges have been detected, in an image, this information can be used to Segment the image, into homogeneous areas. There are other methods available for segmenting an image, apart from using edge detection, like threshold method. This method involves finding the color of each pixel in an image and considering adjacent pixels to be in the same area as long as their color is similar enough. A similar method for segmenting images is splitting and merging. Splitting involves taking an area that is not homogeneous and splitting it into two or more smaller areas, each of which is homogeneous. Merging involves taking two areas that are the same as each other, and adjacent to each other and combining them together into a large area. This provides a sophisticated interactive approach to segmenting an image. Intermediate Level of processing Low Level Processing High Level Processing 7.Expert system:- Expert means the person who had complete knowledge in particular field, ie is called as an expert. The main aim of this problem is with the help of experts, to load their tricks on to the compute and make available those tricks to the other users. The expert can solve the problems with in the time. The goal of this problem is how to load the tricks and ideas of an expert on to the computer, till now the research will be going on. 8. Computer Vision:- It is a simple task to attach a camera to a computer so that the computer can receive visual images. People generally use vision as their primary means of sensing their environment. We generally see more than we here, feel, smell, or taste. The goal of computer vision research is to give computers this powerful facility for understanding their surroundings. Currently, one of the primary uses of computer vision is in the area of Robotics. 9. Robotics:- A robot is an electro – mechanical device that can be programmed to perfume manual tasks. The robotics industries association formally defines to move a Robot as a “ Programmable multi-functional manipulator designed to move material, parts, tools, or specialized devices through variable programmed motions for the performance of variety of tasks”. Not all robotics is considered to be part of AI. A Robot that perform sonly the actions that it is has been pre- programmed to perform is considered to be a “dumb” robot, includes some kind of sensory apparatus, such as a camera , that allows it to respond to changes in its environment , rather than just to follow instructions “mindlessly”. 10. Intelligent Computer – Assisted Instruction:- Computer - Assisted Instruction (CAI) has been used in bringing the power of the computer to bear on the educational process. Now AI methods are being applied to the development of intelligent computerized “ Tutors” that shape their teaching techniques to fit the leaning patterns of individual students. 11. Automatic Programming:- Programming is the process of telling the computer exactly what we want to do . the goal of automatic programming is to create special programs that act as intelligent “Tools” to assist programmers and expedite each phase of the programming process. The ultimate aim of automatic programming is a computer system that could develop programs by itself, in response to an in according with the specifications of the program developer. 12. Planning and Decision Support system:- When we have a goal, either we rely on luck and providence to achieve that goal or we design and implement a plan. The realization of a complex goal may require to construction of a formal and detailed plan. Intelligent planning programs are designed to provide active assistance in the planning process and are expected to the particularly helpful to managers with decision making responsibilities. 13. Engineering Design & Camical Analysis:- Artificial Intelligence applications are playing major role in Engineering Drawings & Camical analysis to design expert drawings and Camical synthesis. 14. Neural Architecture:- People or more intelligent than Computers,. But AI researchers are trying how make Computers Intelligent. Humans are better at interpreting noisy input, such as recognizing a face in a darkened room from an odd angle. Even where human may not be able to solve some problem, we generally can make a reasonable guess as to its solution. Neural architectures, because they capture knowledge in a large no. of units. Neural architectures are robust because knowledge is distributed somewhat uniformly around the network. Neural architectures also provide a natural model for parallelism, because each neuron is an independent unit. This showdown searching the data base a massively parallel architecture like the human brain would not suffer from this problem. 15. Heuristic Classification:- The term Heuristic means to Find & Discover., find the problem and discover the solution. For solving complex AI problems it’s requires lots of knowledge and some represented mechanisms in form of Heuristic Search Techniques., i.e refered to known as Heuristic Classification. AI currently encompasses a huge variety of subfields, ranging from general purpose areas such as learning and perception to such specific tasks as playing chess, proving mathematical theorems, writing poetry and diagnosing diseases. 16 Commonsense reasoning It is the branch of Artificial intelligence concerned with replicating human thinking. In theory, if the computer is endowed with good Knowledge Representation Database, including a comprehensive common sense database, and is able to process and respond in plain-text English, it will have the ability to process and reason with English texts. The task of Common Sense Knowledge is probably the least studied area, though it is included in many ways in knowledge representation task. There are two issues with this ,one is how to represent the knowledge gathered in a computer processible, and human accessible way. The second task is actually collecting the Common Sense knowledge. There are a couple of different groups who are doing this now. Knowledge Gathering is usually done for expert systems and is limited in its breadth to a limited domain. The two common sense projects are Open Mind Common Sense and Cycorp. To investigate this sort of problems General Problem Solver was developed. Topic-7 The Birth and Development of Present day AI Research.! While Alan Turning is generally recognized as the ‘father’ of Artificial Intelligence. Many of his contemporaries were also trying to understand the similarities between mind and machines. The early contribution to his area came mostly from, the scientist of the united states and of Great Britan . Warren McCullots in 1953 proposed that a network of neurons or a natural net in the brain worked in a manner similar to that of the hypothetical turning machine. The idea of considering the brain as a computer was thus born in 1937, Cludeshanon used Boolean algebra to describe the operation of electrical switching circuits. This idea was later used to develop the binary system of information storage used in the digital computers. Shanon is also one of the first scientist to consider the possibility of using computers to play chess. In particular he pointed out that having a computer consider every possible combination of moves was not a practical strategy for chess playing since, even at the rate of evaluation of one million moves per second. How ever, real AI research programme can be said to have started in 1956 when John McCarthy , one of the organizers of the Dratmouch Conference, suggested the name ‘ ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE’ for the new branch of computer science that took shape during the conference.The conference witnessed participation of scientists from widely varying fields such as neurology mathematics, psychology, cognition, behavioural science and Engineering. A part from the United States, AI research is underway in many countries like Great Britan,France and Japan has launched one of the worlds largest AI-Project called the Fifth Generation Project a ten year 450 Million Dollar AI research project. In India also AI research is underway in institution like IISC and IIT , Kanpur. Topic-8 What is Intelligent Agents?? Agent • An agent is anything that can be viewed as perceiving its environment through sensors and acting upon that environment through actuators • Human agent: eyes, ears, and other organs for sensors; hands, legs, mouth, and other body parts for actuators • Robotic agent: cameras and infrared range finders for sensors; various motors for actuators • Scooter: touch and rotation sensors; wheels • The agent function maps from percept histories to actions: [f: P*  A] • The agent program runs on the physical architecture to produce f • agent = architecture + program 1.Agents and Environments Agent  perceiving its environment through sensors and acting upon that environment through actuators • Human agent - eyes, ears and other organs for sensors - legs, mouth and other body parts for actuators • Robotic agent - Cameras and infra-red range finders for sensors - Various motors for actuators - Software agent -keystrokes, file contents, network packets as sensory inputs - display screen, writing files, sending network packets • percept – agent’s perceptual input at any given instant • Percept sequence – complete history of everything the agent ever perceived • Agent function – maps any given percept sequence to an action - tabulating all agent function (all possible percept sequence) - external characterization - abstract mathematical description • Agent program - internal characterization - implementation 1. Vacuum cleaner world • Percepts: location and contents, e.g., [A,Dirty] • Actions: Left, Right, Suck, NoOp Tabulation of agent function 2. Good Behaviour : Concept of Rationality • Rational Agent - doing right thing -every entry in the agent function table is correct - right action causes the agent to be more successful • Performance measures - embodies the criterion for success of an agent’s behaviour - not one fixed measure suits for all the agents -vacuum cleaner (amount of dirt cleaned up) amount of time taken, amount of electricity consumed, amount of noise generated, etc. • For each possible percept sequence, a rational agent should select an action that is expected to maximize its performance measure, given the evidence provided by the percept sequence and whatever built-in knowledge the agent has • Rationality - It depends on 4 things - performance measure - Prior knowledge of environment - Actions - Percept sequence • Definition of rational agent -for each possible percept sequence, an agent should select an action that maximizes its performance measure - vacuum cleaner a) Performance measure – awarding points b) Prior knowledge – geography of environment c) Actions – left, right, suck, NoOp d) Percept sequence – perceiving dirt locations • omniscience, learning, autonomy - omniscient agent knows the actual outcome of its actions and can act accordingly - information gathering -exploration - learning – to learn as much as possible from what it perceives -autonomy – agent should learn what it should compensate for partial or incorrect knowledge The Nature of Environments • Task environments • An agent operates within some task environment, not in a blank world. • This environment includes: • what the agent is trying to do • what resources it has to do it • The nature of the environment affects how we design an appropriate agent. - Problems to which the rational agents are the solutions - Specifying Task Environments - PEAS Description - Performance Measure How do we assess whether we are doing the right thing? - Environment- What is the world we are in? - Actuators How do we affect the world we are in? - Sensors How do we perceive the world we are in? • Consider, e.g., the task of designing an automated taxi driver: - Performance measure: Safe, fast, legal, comfortable trip, maximize profits - Environment: Roads, other traffic, pedestrians, customers - Actuators: Steering wheel, accelerator, brake, signal, horn - Sensors: Cameras, sonar, speedometer, GPS, odometer, engine sensors, keyboard Automated Taxi Driver Properties of Task Environments (Types) • Environments have characteristics which affect the design of an agent – Fully vs partially observable – Single agent vs multi-agent – Deterministic vs stochastic – Episodic vs sequential – Static vs dynamic – Discrete vs continuous – Known vs unknown – The Structure of Agents Agent Program – implements the agent function, mapping percepts to action Agent=architecture+program ex:-program – walk architecture – legs PC, Robotic car with on-board computers, cameras and other sensors Agent programs -takes just current percept from the environment Table driven agent Reason for the failure of table driven agent  storage space  table creation takes much time  Cannot learn all entries  No guidance to the designer to fill the table Condition-Action Rule ex: if car in front is braking then initiate braking -learned responses - innate reflexes Schematic diagram of simple reflex agent  Observe the world, choose an action, implement action, done.  Problems if environment is not fully-observable.  Depending on performance metric, may be inefficient. Agent program • • INTERPRET-INPUT generates abstracted description of current state • RULE-MATCH  returns the rule that matches with the current state • Very limited intelligence (lack of full observability) -correct decision can be made only if the environment is fully observable -Ex: if automated taxi driver is a simple reflex agent  behind a car, ti would either brake continuously and unnecessarily or never brake at all -if vacuum cleaner is a simple reflex agent  it would have only dirt sensor and not the location sensor, so only 2 percepts dirty and clean. So it can’t move left or right. 2.Model based Reflex Agents • Suppose moving has a cost? • If a square stays clean once it is clean, then this algorithm will be extremely inefficient. • A very simple improvement would be – Record when we have cleaned a square – Don’t go back once we have cleaned both. • We have built a very simple model. • Handles partial observability • Updating internal state information - Information about how the world evolves independently of the agent - Information about how the agent’s own actions affect the world - Model of the world Schematic diagram Update State  responsible for creating new internal state information 3. Goal based agents • Agent has some information about desirable situations • Needed when a single action cannot reach desired outcome • Therefore performance measure needs to take into account \"the future\". • Typical model for search and planning. • Current state information only is not enough • Goal information Schematic diagram of goal based agent 4. Utility based agent • Possibly more than one goal, or more than one way to reach it • Some are better, more desirable than others • There is a utility function which captures this notion of \"better\". • Utility function maps a state or sequence of states onto a metric. • Utility • Utility function 5. Learning Agents • All agents have methods for selection actions. • Learning agents can modify these methods. • Performance element: any of the previously described agents • Learning element: makes changes to actions • Critic: evaluates actions, gives feedback to learning element Problem generator: suggests actions Topic-9 Problem Solving with AI Makes it difficult to generalize. ************************************THE END*************************************","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
