## Type checking
Type checking is a process performed by compilers or interpreters to ensure that the **types of operands** in an expression or statement are compatible with the **operations** being performed.

It verifies that the operations and assignments in a program are semantically meaningful according to the language's type system. 

in a **statically** typed language like Java or C++ type checking is performed during compile time, In a **dynamically** typed language like Python, type checking is often performed at runtime

## Switch Statement
A switch statement is a control flow statement used to select one of many code blocks to be executed based on the value of a variable or expression. It provides a concise way to write multiple if-else-if statements.

Syntax:

```c
switch (expression) {
    case value1:
        // code block 1
        break;
    case value2:
        // code block 2
        break;
    ...
    default:
        // default code block
}
```

Here's how it works:
- The expression is evaluated.
- The value of the expression is compared with the values in the case labels.
- If a match is found, the corresponding code block is executed.
- If no match is found, the code block under the `default` label is executed (if present).
- The `break` statement is used to exit the switch statement after executing the corresponding code block. If `break` is omitted, control falls through to the next case label, and subsequent code blocks are executed until a `break` is encountered or the switch statement ends.

Switch statements are often used when there are multiple conditions to check against the same variable, providing a cleaner and more readable alternative to using multiple if-else statements.
