## Basic Blocks:
Basic blocks are sequential sequences of code in a program with only one entry point and one exit point. 

A basic block typically starts with a leader instruction and ends with a terminator instruction, such as a jump or branch. The leader instruction is the first instruction of a basic block, and it's usually the target of a branch or the first instruction in the program. The terminator instruction is the last instruction of a basic block, and it transfers control to another basic block or exits the current block.

Basic blocks simplify control flow analysis by breaking down complex code into smaller, manageable chunks. They serve as the foundation for various compiler optimizations, such as code motion, dead code elimination, and register allocation.

## Flow Graph:
A flow graph is a graphical representation of the control flow of a program, depicting the relationships between basic blocks and the control transfers between them. In a flow graph, nodes represent basic blocks, and directed edges represent control flow between these blocks.

The flow graph provides a visual depiction of how a program's execution flows from one basic block to another. It helps compilers and programmers understand the structure of the program and identify opportunities for optimization.
